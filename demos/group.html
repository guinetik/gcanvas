    <strong>Group Demo</strong> —
    A <code>Group</code> is a specialized shape that can contain other shapes. It
    inherits from <code>Shape</code>, which in turn extends our <code>Transformable</code> base. 
    This means a <code>Group</code> has the same properties as any shape—<em>x</em>, 
    <em>y</em>, <em>rotation</em>, <em>scaleX</em>, <em>scaleY</em>, <em>opacity</em>, 
    and <em>visible</em>—and applying transformations (rotation, scaling, etc.) 
    to the group will affect all child shapes as a single unit.<br><br>
    This approach lets you manage and animate collections of shapes as a single entity,
    similar to how grouping worked in Flash.

        <strong>Bezier Curve Editor</strong> â€” Create and modify Bezier curves with interactive control points. <br>
        The demo shows the separation between <strong>Shapes</strong> (visual definitions) and
        <strong>GameObjects</strong> (interactive entities). <br>
        <strong>BezierShape</strong> defines curve paths using commands like "M" (move), "L" (line), "Q" (quadratic),
        and "C" (cubic). <br>
        <strong>Control Points</strong> are wrapped with ShapeGOFactory to make them interactive, while guide lines show
        relationships between points. <br>
        Switch between <strong>Add Points</strong> mode to place new control points and <strong>Edit Points</strong>
        mode to drag and adjust the curve shape.

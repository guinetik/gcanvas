    <strong>Motion Demo</strong> - Showcases reusable animations. Each animation is implemented through a tween system that handles interpolation between values over time. The demo uses a tile-based layout to organize the animations in a grid, with each animation contained in its own box. Under the hood, the system manages animation timing through a central update loop, applying mathematical transformations to the shapes' positions based on normalized time values (0-1) that loop continuously.
